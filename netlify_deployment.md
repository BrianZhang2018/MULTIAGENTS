# Netlify Deployment for ATLAS Interview Demo

## Option 1: Static Frontend + Netlify Functions (Recommended)

**Perfect for interviews** - Professional, fast, reliable

### Architecture:
- **Frontend**: HTML/JavaScript (static site)
- **Backend**: Netlify serverless functions (Python)
- **API**: Gemini through Netlify Functions

### Steps:

1. **Create Frontend**
```html
<!-- index.html - Professional demo interface -->
<html>
<head>
    <title>ATLAS - JPMorgan Chase Demo</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Demo interface with form and results -->
</body>
</html>
```

2. **Create Netlify Functions**
```python
# netlify/functions/process_inquiry.py
import json
from google.generativeai import configure, GenerativeModel
```

3. **Deploy to Netlify**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Option 2: Full JavaScript Version (Simpler)

**Even easier** - Pure frontend with mock responses for demo

### Benefits:
- No backend needed
- Instant deployment
- Perfect for interview demos
- No API costs during demo

### Implementation:
```javascript
// Mock the multi-agent system in JavaScript
const agents = {
    orchestrator: (inquiry) => determineAgent(inquiry),
    customer_service: (inquiry) => mockCustomerServiceResponse(inquiry),
    // ... other agents
}
```

## Recommended Approach for Interview:

### **JavaScript Version** (Fastest to deploy)

1. **Create `index.html`** - Professional demo interface
2. **Add `script.js`** - Mock multi-agent logic  
3. **Push to GitHub**
4. **Connect to Netlify** - Auto-deploy
5. **Get public URL** - Share with interviewer

### Timeline: 30 minutes to deploy!

Would you like me to build:
1. **Quick JS version** (30 min) - Mock responses, perfect for demo
2. **Full Python version** (2 hours) - Real Gemini integration

For the interview, I recommend the **Quick JS version** because:
- ✅ Professional looking
- ✅ Shows agent architecture  
- ✅ Demonstrates routing logic
- ✅ No API costs
- ✅ Always works (no API failures)
- ✅ Fast loading

Which approach would you prefer?
